# Password-Generator

In this project I've developed a password generator that starts once the "generate password" button is clicked and takes the user through a series of prompts. 

The user must first select the amount of characters they would like to include, between 8 and 128 characters. If the user inputs a # of characters that is less than 8 they are instructed to choose a number equal or greater than 8; if they choose a value greater than 128, they are instructed to choose a value that is equal to or less than 128.

Next the user is led through a series of prompts, asking to confirm if they would like to include four character types: special, numeric, lowercase, and uppercase. The user must select at least one of these character types, and if they do not do so, they are instructed to please choose at least one and led through the options of character types again.
